Step 4a: Hooks
For this step, we referenced Workshops 6 and 8.

W6 taught us how to use Bandit for Static Analysis and W8 taught
us about creating a pre-commit file. With these practices, we made
a pre-commit file that uses Bandit to analyze any files that will 
be commited, any problems with the files will be recorded in a file
called security_report.csv. 


Step 4b: Fuzzing


Step 4c: Forensics


Step 4d: CI

For this step, we essentially did the exact same thing we did in 
Workshop 9 with the Codacy Analysis tool. No extra steps were taken.
